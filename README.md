## Objective 🎯

  

The goal of this technical test is to code a **National Aeronautics and Space Administration** - **NASA** footage website. It will require you to read, understand and implement the API´s NASA, and create a basic user interface to present the data.

  

  

## Structure 🛠️

  

In this repository's **master** branch you are provided with a clean architechture modular-based boilerplate that allows you to quickly start developing your app in Angular. As advice, we recommend to follow project´s structure and build on modular-based, if modular-based is kind of complex for you ,then, feel free to change and build as you want.

  
You must install any library or dependecie you want to use with **npm** please avoid using CDN´s.

Everything related to logos, icons and fonts must be downloaded and used from the `/assets` folder within the project, feel free to use either boostrap, angular material, tailwind, SASS, LESS as CSS frameworks or if you want use pure CSS.

  

## API 🔗

  

The **NASA - api** contains all images and videos you will be using, so please, don´t implement or use another API or external footage source. For more convenience, you can [check out the NASA-API documentation here](https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf).

  

From your code, you can access to the API at `https://images-api.nasa.gov/` as a main URL and as hint you can use:

  

-  `/recent.json`

-  `/popular.json`

-  `/search?q=&page=&media_type=,,&year_start=&year_end=`

  

## What we're expecting 🕵️

  

We expect your code to work without bugs and implement the following features:

  

- Display recent images and videos

- Display popular images and videos

- Show detail of images
  

You can check this [NASA Website](https://images.nasa.gov/) to have an idea.

  

We also expect your code to be a reflection of yourself at work, so we will be attentive to the choices you'll make regarding code architecture, readability and performance.

  

  

## What we're not expecting 🚩

  

We suggest you don't spend too much time on your UI, we know how time intensive it can be. The same can be said for browser compatibility, just make sure your app works in one evergreen browser, like Chrome for instance. Make it simple and yours!
  

## Bonus features 🌟

  

If you have some time left and want to go a little bit further, here are some feature ideas you can add to this app:

  
- Search images and videos
  
- Filter images and videos

- Login (Google)

- Logout

- Simple Profile

- Wish List

- Make the app responsive

  

## Submission ⌛

The technical test will be enable on 10/07 at 5:00 pm and the due date to complete this test is this Sunday 10/09 at 5:00 pm.

Once you complete the test, push all the project to *your own repository and make it public* and send to us your reposiritory link to hello@origencorp.net before the time and deadline so that we can clone your project. We will later be scheduling the day and time to conduct the technical interview.

 
  

## Now you are ready, Happy Coding! 👊😎
